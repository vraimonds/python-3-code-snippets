# Python 3 Code Snippets and Demos

This is a personal collection of Python 3 code snippets of various modules in Python 3 and their demonstrations that I had worked with. The collection is expected to be extended in the future as I will be working with other new modules for my other projects.

The main purpose of this collection is to have a place for all my tryout code snippets so that it can be used for future reference when encountering any of the modules used from the past.
